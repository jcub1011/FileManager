# Implementation Plan — File Pipeline Utility (spec v2)

This folder breaks [`../spec-draft-v2.md`](../spec-draft-v2.md) into an ordered set of **milestones**,
one file per milestone. Each milestone is independently buildable and verifiable, and depends only on
milestones before it.

> **Status of the repository today:** the codebase is a placeholder — a thin Avalonia 12 / .NET 10
> MVVM *file-browser* scaffold (single `FileManager` project, no tests, no CI). None of the spec's
> architecture exists yet, so this is effectively a greenfield build.

## How to use this plan

- Read milestones in order (M0 → M9). Each file states its **dependencies**, **scope**, a **task
  checklist**, the **proposed code structure**, and **acceptance criteria**.
- "Out of scope" items in each milestone name the later milestone that owns them, so nothing is lost.
- Spec section numbers (e.g. §3.3, Appendix B) refer to `spec-draft-v2.md`.

## Proposed solution architecture

Product namespace **`FileManager`** (matches the spec's IPC names, e.g. `filemanager-<user>`). The
existing `src/FileManager` project is retired in M0; its reusable pieces migrate into the new
projects.

| Project | Role | First built in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/FileManager.Core` | Engine library: Profile models, Job lifecycle, filters, transformers, verification, rollback, journal, watcher, scheduler, worker pool, trash/metadata. No UI deps; AOT-compatible. | M0 |
| `src/FileManager.Contracts` | IPC message contracts shared by Service/GUI/Shell (length-prefixed JSON DTOs). | M0 |
| `src/FileManager.Service` | Headless Core Service host: wires engine + IPC server + optional tray; autostart units. | M6 |
| `src/FileManager.Gui` | Avalonia configuration GUI (repurposed from `FileManager`): Profile editor, activity view, dry-run. | M7 |
| `src/FileManager.Shell` | Shell integration: Windows `IExplorerCommand` handler + registry fallback launcher; Linux file-manager actions; CLI fallback. | M8 |
| `tests/FileManager.Core.Tests` | Unit tests for the engine. | M0 |
| `tests/FileManager.Integration.Tests` | End-to-end acceptance tests (spec §12). | M9 |

### Engine service & dependency pattern

`FileManager.Core` follows a **functional-core / imperative-shell** design. Two kinds of code live in
the engine and they are wired differently — apply this consistently across all milestones:

- **Side-effecting / business-logic collaborators are interface-backed services.** Any class that
  performs I/O, spawns processes, talks to the OS, or encapsulates a swappable policy is defined
  behind an interface (`IFileOperations`, `IProcessRunner`, `ILogSink`, `IFilterEvaluator`,
  `IDedupeIndex`, `ITransformerRunner`, `IConflictResolver`, `ISourceDisposer`, and the M3+
  `IVerifier` / `ITrashService` / etc.) and takes its dependencies through its **constructor**. The
  `JobEngine` orchestrator holds these collaborators as interfaces so the lifecycle can be unit-tested
  with fakes (e.g. a `FakeProcessRunner`, a reject-all `IFilterEvaluator`) without touching the real
  filesystem or launching subprocesses. New phase logic that does I/O or carries policy should be
  added as such a service, **not** as a `static` method that takes an `IFileOperations` parameter.
- **Pure functions stay `static`.** Stateless, deterministic helpers with no side effects
  (`PathNormalizer`, `TokenExpander`, `TargetResolver`, `GlobMatcher`, `DurationParser`, `HashUtil`,
  `ProfileValidator`, `ProfileSerializer`, `AtomicFileWriter`, …) remain `static`. Putting these
  behind interfaces buys no testability or substitutability and only adds ceremony.

**Wiring is manual** — plain constructor composition in `JobEngine` (and, from M6, in the
`FileManager.Service` host). There is **no DI container**: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
is AOT-compatible for explicit registration, but adding it would violate the rule that
`FileManager.Core` / `FileManager.Contracts` stay dependency-free and reflection-free. `JobEngine`
exposes a full constructor that accepts every collaborator interface (the seam tests and future host
use this) plus a convenience constructor that builds the standard implementations over an
`IFileOperations`, so call sites that don't need to substitute anything stay terse.

## Dependency graph

```
M0 ─► M1 ─► M2 ─► M3 ─► M4 ─► M5 ─► M6 ─► M7 ─► M8
 │                                    ▲           │
 └────────────────────────────────────┘           │
                                                   ▼
M0…M8 ──────────────────────────────────────────► M9
```

`M0` also feeds `M6` directly (the `FileManager.Contracts` project). `M9` depends on everything.
